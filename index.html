						<p>Ever had more than a page of notes in the default notes app and cannot find the one you need? Well then this application is for you. Remembr is based around "Categories" and "Items" inside those categories.<br><br>

	                    All you have to do is create a new category and start making notes. All your notes are organized as you want them. No more mixing "School" notes with your "Movies to Watch" list.<br><br>

	                    The application gives you the freedom of choosing a colour for your category and an icon. For an item/note you can also use you camera or photo gallery to add an image along with the notes.</p>
